Take the Global Superstore data set.

Add the columuns are Profit Margin, Cost columuns in the Superstore data set. 
Import the data set into the Power bi. 

Financial KPI Columns Added. 
Profit Margin 
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Profit], [Sales])  

#It will fill all the columns without the below errors for the Caluculation=IFERROR(G2/F2,0)
Sales is in column F
Profit is in column G
You want Profit Margin in column H
Calculates Profit ÷ Sales
Avoids #DIV/0! errors
Is equivalent to Power BI’s DIVIDE()
Profit Margin was calculated in Excel using a dynamic formula with error handling to ensure accurate results even when sales values are zero. The formula was auto-filled across the dataset using Excel table functionality for scalability and consistency.

Cost (Optional but Powerful)
Cost = [Sales] - [Profit]

#Calculation Steps:
=IFERROR(S2 - V2, 0)
Sales = column S
Profit = column V
Cost was derived in Excel by subtracting Profit from Sales using a row-wise formula with error handling. The calculation was auto-filled across the dataset using Excel table functionality to maintain consistency and scalability.

KPI MEASURES Taken. 
Total Sales = SUM('Table'[Sales])
Total Profit = SUM('Table'[Profit])
Average Margin = AVERAGE('Table'[Profit Margin])
KPI measures such as Total Sales, Total Profit, and Profit Margin were calculated using a centralized fact table containing transactional data. Supporting dimension tables for date, product, and region were used to enable filtering and drill-down analysis, following a star schema design.

STEP 1: Import Dataset
Open Power BI Desktop
Home → Get Data → Excel / CSV
Load your dataset
Click Load

Make sure these columns exist:
Sales
Profit
Order Date

STEP 2: Create KPI MEASURES (IMPORTANT: Measures, not columns)
Go to Data view or Report view → Modeling → New measure
Total Sales (Measure) Total Sales = SUM('Fact_Sales'[Sales])
Total Profit (Measure) Total Profit = SUM('Fact_Sales'[Profit])
Profit Margin (Measure) Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales], 0)

This:
Prevents divide-by-zero errors
Updates dynamically with slicers

STEP 3: Format the Measures (Very Important)
Total Sales
Format: Currency
Decimal places: 0 or 2
Total Profit
Format: Currency
Profit Margin
Format: Percentage
Decimal places: 1–2

STEP 4: Create KPI CARDS (Dashboard Top Section)
Go to Report View  - Insert Card visual
Card 1
Field: Total Sales
Title: Total Sales
Card 2
Field: Total Profit
Title: Total Profit
Card 3
Field: Profit Margin
Title: Profit Margin
